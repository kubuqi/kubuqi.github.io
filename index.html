    <h5>Enterprise Networking Group, July 2010 – Present (5 years 10 months)</h5>
    I worked on <a href="http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/collateral/ios-nx-os-software/ios-xe-3sg/QA_C67-622903.html">the networking OS</a> for Cisco enterprise routers & switches like ASR1K, ASR900, ISR-4K and cBR-8, and more to come with project Polaris.<br />
    I owned infrastructures which support networking features development, including:<br />
    - Forwarding managers – the core IOS-XE programming schedulers.<br />
    - IPC, named memory allocation, chunk allocator, in-memory DB, in-service-software-upgrade…<br />
    - Memory usage profiling and debugging.<br />
    - Performance analysis and trouble shooting.<br />
    I was the infra go-to guy, and I provided infrastructure support for over 16 major releases - XE3.2 through XE3.18.<br />
    I took initiative to refactor interface manager code and CFM code; in both cases thousands of lines of code were killed. I <a href="https://github.com/kubuqi/kubuqi.github.io/wiki/Measure-to-Improve:-How-I-cut-Binos-Rebuild-Time-by-50%25">enhanced our building script</a> to cut rebuild time by 50%, which affects ~1000 developer’s daily work.<br />
    Owner of L2 networking technologies including CFM and AToM, also worked on VPLS, Q-in-Q and Bridge-Domain.<br />

    <h5>Video and Content Networking BU, January 2008 – June 2010 (2 years 6 months)</h5>
    I worked on Cisco Content Delivery System, particularly in video streaming from both kernel and user space.<br />
    I made following performance enhancements.<br />
    - TCP send offload, which reduced CPU usage by 50%.<br />
    - Offload live streaming channel traffic over multiple CPU cores.<br />
    - Developed tools to stress the system, identified bottle necks and improved it, which effectively cut CPU usage from 40% to 4%.<br />
    Frame lost debuggings.<br />
    Fix kernel coredumps.<br />
</p>
<p>
    <h5>IPC BU, June 2005 – December 2007 (2 years 7 months)</h5>
  IP telephony gateway<br>
  - Lead the call processing team to accomplish the H.248 project on time with decent quality.<br>
  - Acting as Design Authority in MGCP/H.248/GTD to provide technical consulting to peers.<br>
  - Hacking MDL language compiler to support signalling team.<br>
  - H323, SIP, SS7 call signalling.<br>

I worked on a high performance H323 Gatekeeper on Linux in C++, with multi-thread server programming and STL.<br />
I designed & implemented a dedicated media proxy to work with the Gatekeeper to offload media traffic, which effectively scaled out our system capacity.<br />

<h3><a id="mediafair" class="anchor" href="#mediafair" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Media Fair, Fax Broadcast System, October 2001 – May 2003 (1 year 8 months)</h3>
I took initiative to rewrite from scratch our fax broadcast system. This outperformed our old system by 400%, was capable of sending 20,000 fax jobs per day, and generated all revenue for MeiaFair.<br />
It was a multi-threaded Win32 server, worked with variety types of fax boards, capable of on-demand page rendering, an with multiple job report options.<br />
I also built a win32 fax client which intercepts the print driver to generate the fax jobs, and uploads to outbound server.<br />
