This is a somewhat definite answer to a myth about how water whirls in different directions depending on whether you happen to be on the North or South Hemisphere. <BR>
This myth has been a interesting subject to me for a long time. Besides that, the way these two guys representing their experiments was fasinating. They created two separated videos, one representing what would happen in the northen part of hemisphere, and another for the same test down the south. They edited their video in a way that you can actually enjoy watching both videos at same time, while maintaining a smooth transision back and forth. <BR>
I found this way of representing really interesting, and created this page for a friend, so that you do not need to manually sync the two videos.<BR>
    
I hope you Enjoyed it.<BR>
